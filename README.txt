My Project:
	Usually the sudoku games we play on mobiles on android does not give you the solution to the puzzle. Or while solving a sudoku puzzle manually it can be easy while solving a easy puzzle but it will be a hectic job to solve a hard puzzle. So my code gives you directly the solution to the sudoku puzzle.
	Enter the sudoku puzzle in 9*9 format while writing the elements in the row first. Give 0 for blank spaces.
	For eg.
		2 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0
		8 0 4 0 6 2 0 0 3
		0 1 3 8 0 0 2 0 0
		0 0 0 0 2 0 3 9 0
		5 0 7 0 0 0 6 2 1
		0 3 2 0 0 6 0 0 0
		0 2 0 0 0 9 1 4 0
		6 0 1 2 5 0 8 0 9
		0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2

	This is one sudoku puzzle.

	Note:
		This is not a sudoku game. It only gives solution to a sudoku puzzle.
